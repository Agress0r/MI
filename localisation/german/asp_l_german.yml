### AI event on the planet
asp_agr.1.name:0 "Energy signature"
asp_agr.1.desc:0 "During construction §Y[This.GetName]§! detected strange signals сoming from §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!.\n\nApparently this is some kind of data warehouse, and the main computer seems to be still in service. From the data retrieved, it can be understood that it was once an §RAI§! that occupied one of the leading positions in an empire, about which there is practically no data left.\n\n§YReactivate the AI matrix§!?"

After analyzing and translating them, it became clear that earlier this §YAI§! could easily adapt to different government positions, and after the last activation due to failures in the recognition system, he recognized us as their, so a standard protocol was launched and initialized.\n\nShould we take the opportunity, or is it better to take it apart?"

asp_agr.4.name:0 "§YResources found§!"
asp_agr.4.desc:0 "During the construction of the station, several containers were found above the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. As it turned out, there were a number of rare resources inside."
asp_agr.4.a:0 "This will come in handy"

### Artifact Event
asp_agr.5.name:0 "§YArtifacts found§!"
asp_agr.5.desc:0 "During the construction of the station, several containers of different shapes and colors were found above the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. As it turned out, all sorts of artifacts were stored inside them."

### Event with an increase in energy production at the facility
asp_agr.6.name:0 "§YThe increase in the nominal power§!"
asp_agr.6.desc:0 "The data from the sensors of the §Y[This.GetName]§! and from the station above the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! object vary greatly. The nominal performance turned out to be several levels higher than the previously announced values."

### Event and excavation - a mysterious object
asp_agr.7.name:0 "An unexpected twist"
asp_agr.7.desc:0 "An incident occurred in the orbit of the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. During the construction of the mining station, a powerful surge of unknown energy occurred in the area of the planet's orbit, after which the construction ship §Y[This.GetName]§! was destroyed in the blink of an eye - not a trace of it remained!\n\nSubsequent expeditions were able to find a certain station that is stationary in the orbit of the planet. She does not respond to attempts to get in touch; therefore, a special team of highly qualified researchers will be required for further study."

asp_agr_ancrel_site:0 "Unknown in the distance"
asp_agr_ancrel_site_desc:0 "At first glance, this station does not represent something worthwhile - an ordinary ancient structure left over from ancient times. But how can there be such an amazing power in this ancient giant? Even a thorough external examination of the station's casing did not give significant results, it remains to be hoped for an infiltration group."

asp_agr_ancrel.1.name:0 "The first details"
asp_agr_ancrel.1.desc:0 "The group of scientists that were able to bypass the security systems and get inside was surprised. Outwardly, the space station looks very peaceful and elegant, although it has been in disrepair for a very long period of time. In several places you can see scattered unknown equipment and household items. A detailed study of these items can be very useful."

asp_agr_ancrel.2.name:0 "What's left behind"
asp_agr_ancrel.2.desc:0 "After exploring several rooms in a row, the group did not find anything interesting - only broken or damaged equipment, as well as a lot of scattered objects that somehow resemble portable containers for things.\n\nAfter going through a few more sections, the leader of the group discovered a very strange thing - a huge hole that had been made quite recently. Maybe there is still life at the station?"

asp_agr_ancrel.3.name:0 "Unknown ship"
asp_agr_ancrel.3.desc:0 "It turned out that the shot hole formed quite recently belonged to the ship, which is located inside the docking station. Apparently, it was this shot that destroyed the construction ship and its crew ... But why did the ship fire?\n\nA team of scientists decided to head straight to the docks and study the ship in more detail."

asp_agr_ancrel.4.name:0 "Dormant god"
asp_agr_ancrel.4.desc:0 "Once on the ship, a terrifying picture appeared before the scientists. Bones and remains of the station's past residents were scattered everywhere on the decks - apparently the latter tried to find salvation on this ship, but for some unknown reason failed.\n\nAfter going to the bridge, the leader of the group activated the working equipment available there. The ship's log contained only one entry, dating back several centuries. The recording spoke of remote activation of the weapon system with the aim of eliminating any enemy that approaches the ship.\n\nThe ship itself, with the exception of weapons systems, is almost completely out of order, but it can still be useful for further reverse engineering."

### An event about the ship of the FE
asp_agr.8.name:0 "Drifting wanderer"
asp_agr.8.desc:0 "Construction work on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! object led to interesting consequences. The builder discovered a ship of unknown design - the ship does not look like anything that exists in our empire.\n\nAs it turned out from the side of the ship's log, the ship was decommissioned and for some reason left not far from the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. Be that as it may, the crew of §Y[This.GetName]§! miraculously managed to take control of it, and now the crew is awaiting a decision on this vessel."
asp_agr.8.a:0 "Send the ship to the nearest dock."
asp_agr.8.a.tooltip:0 "§YThe captured ship will be added to the fleet§!"
asp_agr.8.b:0 "Disassemble the ship"

### Event with an increase in the production of minerals at the site
asp_agr.9.name:0 "§YNew deposits founded§!"
asp_agr.9.desc:0 "First estimate of available resources at §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! proved to be inaccurate. After the re-analysis revealed that the real value of the mineral deposits is much higher!"

### Event with an increase in the production of a rare resource at the facility
asp_agr.10.name:0 "§YProduction optimization§!"
asp_agr.10.desc:0 "Thanks to more accurate equipment tuning, the crew of the §Y[This.GetName]§! was able to multiply the potential capacity of the mining equipment at the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! facility!."

### Event with an increase in engineering at the facility
asp_agr.13.name:0 "§YAdditional expenses§!"
asp_agr.13.desc:0 "The planned research station over the §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! may require additional costs. The crew of §Y[This.GetName]§! made a proposal: potential of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! in terms of scientific research can be much higher if the object is provided with an additional budget."
asp_agr.13.a:0 "Allocate additional resources"

### Event with the destruction of the mining station above the object
asp_agr.15.name:0 "§RMining Station destroyed§!"
asp_agr.15.desc:0 "Communication with the §Y[asp_agr_gg_mining_station.GetName]§! mining station has just been lost. Apparently the station was completely destroyed ... But what caused the explosion? Was it Sabotage? Or builders in the construction of the station somewhere missed a couple of details? The answer to this question can no longer be found."
asp_agr.15.a:0 "Mining station §Y[asp_agr_gg_mining_station.GetName]§! destroyed."

### The event with the destruction of the science station above the object
asp_agr.17.name:0 "§RScience Station destroyed§!"
asp_agr.17.desc:0 "Communication with the §Y[asp_agr_gg_science_station.GetName]§! science station has just been lost. Apparently the station was completely destroyed ... But what caused the explosion? Was it Sabotage? Or carelessness of scientists? The answer to this question is no longer known."
asp_agr.17.a:0 "Science station §Y[asp_agr_gg_science_station.GetName]§! destroyed."

### Событие с баффом от научной станции
asp_agr.19.name:0 "§TAmazing discovery§!"
asp_agr.19.desc:0 "The diligence and resourcefulness of the scientists from §Y[asp_agr_science_station_buff.GetName]§! station bore fruit. Thanks to their discoveries and local achievements, our empire will be able to accelerate technological progress in many scientific fields."

### Событие с учёным от научной станции
asp_agr.21.name:0 "§TSkillful laboratory assistant§!"
asp_agr.21.desc:0 "The scientific representative of §Y[asp_agr_science_station_leader.GetName]§! science station addressed us with a personal request. One of his laboratory assistants shows high results on tests, is well versed in theory and has excellent results in practice, so the station representative asked us to raise a laboratory assistant to a senior scientist so that his talent would not be wasted."
